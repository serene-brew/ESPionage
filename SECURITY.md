# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in **ESPionage**, I encourage you to report it responsibly.
Please open an issue and mention the following:

- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- The potential impact
- Suggested fixes or patches (if any)

If the report is valid and in-scope, I will work on a fix and notify you once it's resolved. Security advisories will be published if necessary.

**Do not** create public issues or pull requests that include sensitive information.
